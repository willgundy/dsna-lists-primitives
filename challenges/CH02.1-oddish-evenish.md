This challenge is from [Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/r6TSNwkLZ2DgsoKiH)

## Challenge

Write a function that determines whether a number is Oddish or Evenish. A number is Oddish if the sum of all of its digits is odd, and a number is Evenish if the sum of all of its digits is even. If a number is Oddish, return "Oddish". Otherwise, return "Evenish".

```js
function oddishOrEvenish(number) {
```

> **You can assume valid input**

## Test Cases

Input | Output | Because
---|---|---
`121` | `'Evenish'` | `1 + 2 + 1 = 4`
`41` | `'Oddish'` | `4 + 1 = 5`
