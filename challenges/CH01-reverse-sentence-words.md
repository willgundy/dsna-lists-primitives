Reverse Words
---

## Rules

You can (and should) use built in methods

## Challenge

Write a function that takes a sentence string and returns a new string that is the same sentence, but with each word reversed (backwards). The order of words does not change.

**HINT:** Maybe arrays already have a way to do this?

```js
function reverseWords(sentence) {
```

> **You can assume valid inputs and no punctuation**

## Test Cases

Input | Output
---|---
`'alchemy rocks gold'` | `'ymehcla skcor dlog'`
